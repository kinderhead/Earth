A scuffed interactive map of the Earth with a few toggleable features. It covers topics 5 and 6.

## Features

* Show tectonic plate boundaries.
* Show mountains that are created from converging plates.
* Show hotspot locations (extra data crashes my computer.)

This project uses the dataset [here](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates), which uses this as a source. The data is used to dynamically generate tectonic plate boundaries and orogens.
