# Physical Geology Project 1

A scuffed interactive map of the Earth with a few toggleable features. It covers topics 5 and 6.

## Features

* Show tectonic plate boundaries.
* Show mountains that are created from converging plates.
* Show hotspot locations (extra data crashes my computer.)

This project uses the dataset [here](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates), which uses this as a source. The data is used to dynamically generate tectonic plate boundaries and orogens.

I could not find a dataset for hotspots, so Wikipedia had to do. I manually entered the values under [#List_of_volcanic_regions_postulated_to_be_hotspots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_(geology)#List_of_volcanic_regions_postulated_to_be_hotspots). Trying to get hovering over to work crashes the browser, so no extra information.
